1. npm init -y
2. npm install --save next react react-dom express axios

  Add in package.json:
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },

3. Create pages folder.

  Next will look for pages folder where are the files for routing.
  index.js is the first file that NextJS will read. This will be Home in our application.
  The same Next will look for static folder where is the css.

  First time when we run:
    npm run dev 
  nextjs will create inside root, a folder called .next.

  NextJS has hot reloading by default.

  Create About, Contact components inside pages.

  Create users folder inside pages. Because users is a new directory inside pages, needs a index.js. So when we go to 
  the route /user, NextJS will run index.js.

  Create the components folder and inside the includes folder, and inside put header.js file.

  Create layout folder and inside add mainLayout.js. With this component will wrapp all other components.

4. getInitialProps(context)
  This getInitialProps(context) can be access only from files that are inside pages folder and always must return an object. 
  The context has informations about our request and inside this function can be console.log(context) and the response 
    will be in the terminal not in the browser console. That is because we work with NextJS, our code will run on the server 
    and then will run on the browser.

  So behind the scene, NextJS will run on the server and when everything will be ready, then will go to the browser.
  It's like when we create on server a route we have access to req, res, etc, so here is the same.
  We can destruct from context: pathname, query, asPath, req, res.
  In index.js, or Home component, we get the props from getInitialProps({pathname, query, asPath, req, res})

  Add getInitialProps in a functional component:
  Profile.getInitialProps = ({pathname, query, asPath, req, res}) => { return {values: 'ala bala'}}

  So we injecting props:
    render() {
    console.log('user', this.props.user)
    ...

  with the user:
     user: {
        firstName: "Sorin",
        lastName: "Dragomir"
      }

  Tell to NextJS to wait until this is done:
    const response = await axios.get(
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
      );
  
  before we move to actual component. In this direction we use async and await.
  And we have to use try and catch.

  In a functional component we use getInitialProps() like this:
    const Profile = props => {
      console.log(props);
      return <div>Profile</div>;
    };

    Profile.getInitialProps = async context => {
      console.log(context);
      return {
        value: "ala bala portocala"
      };
    };

5. Create a public folder and inside add static folder, inside css folder, and inside style.css. 
  In the header.js, in Head add the style link:
    <link href="/static/css/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />


  CSS from static will be applied to all routes

5a. Next.js + CSS(we don't use this)
  https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-css

  in next.config.js:
    const withCSS = require('@zeit/next-css')
    module.exports = withCSS({
      cssModules: true
    })

  Create a folder called styles and inside main.css file.

6. Query Params
  On Home if we click on any user we get in browser:
    http://localhost:3000/users/profile/1
  
  In index.js we add the query params:
    <Link href={`/users/profile?userId=${user.id}`}>
  
  but is better to add query params like:
    <Link href={{ pathname: '/users/profile', query: { userId: user.id } }}>
      <a>{user.name}</a>
    </Link>

  then in Profile we get the query from getInitialProps({ query }) and we use it:
    const response = await axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${query.userId}`);
  
  We have to do a request to the server to bring that information, to catch the userId, that is why use async.

  Because Profile is in the folder pages, we get in this.props a prop called url injected in our component. In url we get almost 
    the same information that will get from context.

Use this file to modify the default behaifior of the server

7. Params
  Still in profile.js.
  Sometimes to pass Query Params is not enough, we will need to pass params. Params will be for ex the user id 3:
    http://localhost:3000/users/profile/3

  So we are going here
    href={{ pathname: '/users/profile', query: { userId: user.id } }}
  but in the browser history we want to keep:
    as={`/users/profile/${user.id}`}

  So what we do, we masking the real url(href), with a fake one(as).

  Problem:
  If we reload the browser on:
    http://localhost:3000/users/profile/2
  we get:
    404 This page could not be found.

  because NextJS on refresh page, wants to go on page 2, but this page doesn't exist, because this component 2 never loaded.

  Fix:
  We have to instruct the server how to handle this situation and we do it manually with Express.
  We will create a file that will modify the default behavior of the server, that will be server.js

8. Install Express
  npm install express

  - we install Express to give suport for custom url, clean url, like 
    http://localhost:3000/users/profile/3
    so we tell to express how to handle the url like the one above

  - because now we work on development we use node to open server.js, so add in package.json:
    "dev": "node server.js"

  - in the production we want to start with node the server.js
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js"

9. Create server.js file to combine next with express
  - in top of everything will still be next
  - first, before next will handle the routes, from pages folder, next will run the prepare() method

  - we still start development with
    npm run dev

10. withRouter
  Router receive in props almost same props like withRouter, both imported from next/router
  We can use withRouter instead of Link in any file from components(not in pages) to get pathname, query, to push to an specific url 
    to redirect the user, etc

  Example in message.js:
    import { withRouter } from 'next/router';
    export default withRouter(Message);

  2nd way to show information about the path is, if we use a component inside a component that is in pages, we can get the path 
    from context and pass it as a prop to the child component.

11. Router  
  Example in about.js:
    import Router from 'next/router';
  
  We get almost the same props like in withRouter.

  Router.beforePopState() explained in about.js, used when the user clicks back button.

12. App
  This _app.js is working like a HOC.
  Everything that we render in this app: /home, /about, etc, is going through _app.js
  We create _app.js to overwrite the default behavior. So now index.js is a children of _app.js.
  Now NextJS will look first for _app.js.
