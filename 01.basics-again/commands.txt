1. npm init -y

2. We don't use the react CLI, we use this
  npm install --save next react react-dom

3. We have to let node to know than we want to start nextjs server. We add this in package.json
  - dev is testing server
  "dev": "next",
  - when we finish we run build to upload project to real server
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"

4. Next has to know about our pages, so we create pages folder

5. Run NextJS server:
  npm run dev

  - when we run 1st time this command, next will create a .next folder
  - we have HOT Reloading, so on any change, will reload page automatically

6. We are using Link in header, to not reload the page, when we click on new link in menu,
  because if we use simple <a></a> the page will reload on a new menu link

7. We create mainLayout.js and we wrap all pages that we need the navigation menu
