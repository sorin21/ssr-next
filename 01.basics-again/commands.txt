1. npm init -y

2. We don't use the react CLI, we use this
  npm install --save next react react-dom

3. We have to let node to know than we want to start nextjs server. We add this in package.json
  - dev is testing server
  "dev": "next",
  - when we finish we run build to upload project to real server
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"

4. Next has to know about our pages, so we create pages folder

5. Run NextJS server:
  npm run dev

  - when we run 1st time this command, next will create a .next folder
  - we have HOT Reloading, so on any change, will reload page automatically

6. We are using Link in header, to not reload the page, when we click on new link in menu,
  because if we use simple <a></a> the page will reload on a new menu link

7. We create mainLayout.js and we wrap all pages that we need the navigation menu

8. Lifecycless
  getInitialProps(context) 
    - we gave access to props on every page from Pages. They are available  before the class constructor
    This function must return an object. NextJS will take this returned object and inject it, as props, in the actual component
    - context has all info about the request

    - we destruct context and we get {pathname, query, asPath, req, res}

    query = if we have querys localhost:3000/?hello=name and we get an obj {hello: 'name'}
    asPath = same like query, but we get a string not an object /?hello:name

9. Use a fake online json to get users
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users


10. Style
  1. Inline Style 
    <div style={{color: 'red'}}

  2. Styled JSX
    <div className="jsxStyled">Style with styled jsx</div>
    <style jsx>
      {`
        .jsxStyled {
          color: blue;
        }
      `}
    </style>

  3. Old School link css in <head>
    <link href="/static/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />

    We add this line in mainLayout

10. <Head>
  We import Head from next and what ever we put inside this component, next will put it inside html <head></head>
  import Head from "next/head";

  We add Bootstrap and Google Fonts using links, inside this Head

11. Static Folder
  Next will recognize any static file in the static folder

12. Less, Sass, CSS

13. Query Strings
  <Link href={{ pathname: '/users/profile', query: { userId: user.id } }}>

  That is in index.js
  So we are going to pathname profile and we pass query string {{ pathname: '/users/profile', query: { userId: user.id } }}

14. Params
  as={`/users/profile/${user.id}`}
  <Link href={{ pathname: '/users/profile', query: { userId: user.id } }} as={`/users/profile/${user.id}`}>

  So we are masking the real url pathname: '/users/profile' with the fake one as={`/users/profile/${user.id}`}

15. Server Side support for clean URLs
  We need to install Express to give support for some custom urls. Everything else will be handle by nextjs.
  We create server.js to let nextjs to know about express. All information for each line are in the file.
  We change in package.json from
    "start": "next start"
      to
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js"
    we want to start node with server.js

    and 
    "dev": "node server.js"

16. withRouter
  We create inside components the message.js file to show how withRouter works

17. Router 
  What we get with withRouter we can get with Router. We do all the logic in the about.js

18. _app.js
  In nextjs the file index.js is the first one that the app will read, but now index.js is a children of _app.js.
  We can overwrite the App component that nextjs uses, by creating in pages an _app.js file.

19. Redux
