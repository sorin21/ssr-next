1. npm init -y
2. npm install --save next react react-dom express axios

3. Next will look for pages folder where are the files for routing and index.js is the first file that will read
  The same Next will look for static folder where is the css

4. In index.js, or Home component, we get the props from getInitialProps()

5. CSS from static will be applied to all routes

6. Use this file to modify the default behaifior of the server

7. Install Express
  npm install express

  - for custom url, clean url, like 
    http://localhost:3000/users/profile/3
    so we tell to express how to handle the url like the one above

  - because now we work on development we use node to open server.js
    "dev": "node server.js"

  - in the production we want to start with node the server.js
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js"

8. Create server.js file to combine next with express
  - in top of everything will still be next
  - first, before next will handle the routes, from pages folder, next will run the prepare() method

  - we still start development with
    npm run dev

9. Router receive in props almost same props like withRouter, both imported from next/router

10. We create _app.js to overwrite the default behavior. So now index.js is a children of _app.js.
    Now Next will look first for _app.js.
